# AskMeAnything
**Saas Course Project at ECE-NTUA 2021**: A Q&A app offered as a service (SaaS) to fictional clients.

**Contributors:** *Sokratis Poutas, Angelos Stais*

## Implementation Stack
* Node, Express
* MySQL
* React
## Deployment Links
* [Microservices Heroku App](https://microservices-front-end.herokuapp.com/)
* [SOA Heroku App](https://soa-front-end.herokuapp.com/)

## Functionalities Demonstration
Example questions and answers have been created in both implementations for demonstration purposes.

The following accounts can be used to demonstrate MyProfile page functionality:
|username|password|
|--------|--------|
|red_fish|123|

## Notes

* In Heroku platform when apps are not used for a while they are set to sleep. So when trying to use our app after not being used for a while you may encounter small delays (10-20 sec) until full content of pages (HomePage, BrowseQuestions, MyProfile) and functionalities (SignUp,SignIn, AskQuestion, AnswerQuestion) are served. However after using each page/functionality for the first time no delays are encounted and app runs normally.
